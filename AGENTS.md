# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# Build & Development Commands

## Compilation
- `compile.bat` - Compile AutoHotkey script to executable
- Requires AutoHotkey installed with Ahk2Exe.exe

## Testing
- Manual testing only: run `start@aborruso.ahk` and test keyboard shortcuts
- No automated test framework

# Code Style Guidelines

## AutoHotkey Conventions
- Use semicolons `;` for comments, not `//`
- Use `#SingleInstance Force` at top of main script
- Use `#installKeybdHook` and `#Persistent` for background utilities
- Use `SendInput` for character insertion with Unicode `{U+XXXX}`
- Hotkey format: `!è::` for ALT+è, `!-'::` for ALT+CTRL+'
- Always include `Return` after hotkey definitions
- Use descriptive comments in Italian/English mix as per existing code

## File Structure
- Main script: `start@username.ahk` (copy from `start@aborruso.ahk`)
- Icon: `resources/00C8-500x500.ico`
- Executable: `start@username.exe` (generated by compile.bat)

## Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens for files
- Use descriptive hotkey comments in Italian where appropriate
