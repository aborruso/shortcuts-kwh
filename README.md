# Shortcuts KWH - AutoHotkey Utilities

Windows keyboard shortcuts utility using AutoHotkey to enhance productivity with special character shortcuts and file creation utilities.

**KWH** stands for **Keyboard shortcuts for "Windows habens"** (Latin for "Windows having/possessing").

Specifically designed for Italian keyboard users and developers who need quick access to special characters and file operations.

## 🎯 Features

### Special Italian Characters
Quickly type uppercase Italian accented characters that are hard to reach on standard keyboards:

- `ALT + è` → **È** (uppercase E with grave accent)
- `ALT + à` → **À** (uppercase A with grave accent)
- `ALT + ì` → **Ì** (uppercase I with grave accent)
- `ALT + ò` → **Ò** (uppercase O with grave accent)
- `ALT + ù` → **Ù** (uppercase U with grave accent)
- `ALT + e` → **ə** (schwa, for inclusive language)

### Developer Utilities
Common characters and markdown helpers for developers:

- `ALT + -` → **~** (tilde, for Unix paths and home directory)
- `ALT + '` → **`** (backtick, for markdown inline code and shell commands)
- `CTRL + ALT + '` → **```** (triple backticks, for markdown code blocks)
- `CTRL + F12` → Convert clipboard text to snake_case and paste it
- `WIN + SHIFT + F12` → Convert clipboard text to kebab-case and paste it

### File Creation Shortcuts
Quick file operations in Windows Explorer (only work when Explorer or Desktop is active):

- `CTRL + ALT + M` → Create README.md in current folder and open it
- `ALT + N` → Create new file with custom name in current folder
